# Management API Python Client

## Overview

The Management API Python Client
provides a convenient and efficient way to interact with Contensis,
enabling you to create, update, and manage content effortlessly.
It offers the flexibility to import content either as part of a one-off migration or
as a scheduled task,
making it ideal for bulk operations or integration with external systems.
While primarily designed for use outside a website context,
the API is versatile enough to be used within website projects when needed.

## How It Works

The Python Management Client API acts as a wrapper around the core HTTP services,
handling the complexities of security and data parsing for you.
It allows developers to integrate with Contensis
without needing to manage raw HTTP requests,
streamlining the process of content management.
